So we&apos;ve decided to give a chance for these forgotten gems to shine. One day every week, we will showcasing a video game and a board game, so you can come to the Cube to try them out.</p>

<p>We will be starting this Friday at 4:30pm and this week we will be showcasing the video game Nintendoland and the board game Dominion.</p>

<p>Have your own (multiplayer) game that you think would be cool for people to try? Feel free to bring it in and share the fun!</p>
