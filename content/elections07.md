By becoming an executive, besides leading activities and projects for the society and department, you have a vote on every decision that is made in executive meetings - you literally shape the events that you and your fellow students take part in.  You not only get a chance to improve your  leadership and communication skills, but you will also make new friends and interact with some of faculty and staff members within the CS department.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re interested in getting involved with the Society, these are the positions we&apos;re taking nomination forms for:</p>
<ul>
<li>President
</li><li>Internal Vice President
</li><li>External Vice President
</li><li>Social Coordinator (2 positions)
</li><li>Grad Representative
</li><li>Treasurer
</li><li>Secretary
</li></ul>
