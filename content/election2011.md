<dt>VP External: Akshat Divrkar</dt>
<dd>My name is AKSHAT DIVEKAR and I am a second year CS student running for the position of VP External for the upcoming year. About me, I have strong team working and networking skills, with an ability to lead and work collaboratively. I have also participated in some CSSS initiatives in the past, such as sites of change and simply appreciate the events that the CSSS organizes for us, from monthly barbeques to the career fair and the tech talks. Talking about my experience, I have held executive positions at various clubs in the past and am currently a Webmaster at another club, a tutor for SOS while also being a teaching assistant for CPSC 210. Apart from that, I am always interested in learning about and trying out new things, whatever they may be. I love watching movies and documentaries, designing websites and listening to music (currently learning drums!).</dd>

<dd>Through becoming the VP External/Finance position, I can make CUBE much more relevant to all the students in the Computer Science department. My main focus will be improving both the professional and social aspect of student life through events and career fairs. Thus provide students with more networking opportunities and help launchtheir post-graduate careers. In addition, I have liaised the Corporate Relation role for UBC eProjects, where I&#x2019;ve hadopportunities to network with technology startups and entrepreneurs. And, throughbecoming the VP External/Finance position I see the need to providing students with more events in turning excellent ideas into business plans. This is only just one of the changes I&#x2019;m going to bring with my VP External/Finance position. Please vote for me as your upcoming VP External/Finance position and I guarantee an exciting year is waiting for you!</dd>
