<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>The UBC Vice-President, Students&apos; Office is soliciting nominations for its 2008&#x2013;2009 Student Development Awards. One of these is the Alfred Scow Award for a UBC undergraduate program or department. The Cube is delighted to nominate the computer science department for this award and to do that we would like to compile a number of positive student testimonials for inclusion in the award application.</p>
<p>Our testimonials (stories, comments or quotes) are about your undergrad experiences in CS. For example, you can provide a testimonial about tutoring experiences you&apos;ve offered or received at the Learning Centre or in the Student Lounge, or the impacts you&apos;ve experienced from participating in programs such as Focus on Woman in Computer Science, Tri-Mentoring, Industry Panels, or Co-op. The awards committee is particularly interested in knowing how you&apos;ve been involved with the department, how you may have offered feedback to the department, and how the department has responded to your feedback.</p>
<p>Please send your testimonial to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#add4c4cec8c3d9cec5c8c3edcac0ccc4c183cec2c0"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ef96868c8a819b8c878a81af88828e8683c18c8082">[email&#xA0;protected]</span></a> by February 2nd, 2009 with the following information included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>The name of your program</li>
<li>Your year in the program</li>
</ul>
<p>Please write &quot;Award Testimonial&quot; in the subject line of your e-mail.</p>
<p>Please indicate in your e-mail if you are willing to allow your name to appear with your testimonial. We believe that the more signed testimonials we can give to the awards committee, the stronger the department&apos;s chance will be at winning this prestigious award.</p>
<p>If you send us a testimonial, we will enter your name in a draw to win one of more than 20 prizes, including a $100 <a href="https://amazon.ca/">Amazon.ca</a> gift certificate, Starbucks gift cards, combination USB hub/mug warmers, and UBC Computer Science T-shirts. The draw will be held at the Cube BBQ outside the Reboot Cafe on Thursday, February 5, 2009.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for helping the department take its best shot at winning this award!</p>
