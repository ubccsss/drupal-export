<p>Computing has grown in importance throughout our society and academia. The real importance of computing is not in providing applications. Computing provides the metaphors, notations, and mechanisms for describing processes that have become critical in science and other disciplines. Several years ago, Georgia Tech decided that all students on our campus need to become computationally literate and able to use algorithmic thinking in their disciplines. In the last decade, we have struggled to make that work. We have learned how computing is valued and used in different disciplines. Our challenge has been to motivate undergraduates to pursue their computing education, even if they are not in a computing major. This talk describes some of that history, our current best efforts, and results from studies of these classes.</p>
