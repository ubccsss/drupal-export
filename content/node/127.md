    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><img src="/files/escience_logo.gif" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">Although this event is catered to science students in general, it would be extremely incorrect to say that this isn&apos;t relevant to computer science students!  Computer science is present in almost all branches of science and so, whatever your reason, this would be a good event to go to.</p>
