<p>By now, you should have noticed the totally new redesigned website that is running.  The server&apos;s now been upgraded to Fedora Core 4.  Along with that, we&apos;ve put in a CMS (Content management system) running <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>.  Much of the content from the old site has been migrated into the new database-driven website, however, some pages are still rough around the edges.</p>
<p>The key element we&apos;re trying to emphasize this time around is <b>communication</b>.  It is now easier than ever to stay in touch with what&apos;s going on in the world of Computer Science and at UBC.  New RSS feeds keep you updated on important announcements that can be read with newsfeed readers such as <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> and <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>.  The calendar generates iCalendar-compliant output that can be read with calendar clients such as <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird.html">Mozilla Sunbird</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ical/">Apple iCal</a>.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the new Forums (editor&#x2019;s note: now closed) finally gives a modern, convenient way to ask questions and find answers regarding a whole range of topics that is only limited by your creativity.  And the good news is that you can access this with any (relatively) <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">standards compliant browser</a>. ;-)</p>
<p>Feel free to sign up for an account (editor&#x2019;s note: public accounts now closed) and start posting!  Any questions can be diverted to the email address at the footer of your screen.</p>
