<p>Google is headed your way!</p>
<p>Not only are we coming to campus, we&apos;re busy solving a bunch of problems that might interest you too. Problems in global information access. Natural language processing. Large-scale system design. Machine translation. Artificial intelligence. </p>
<p>But it&apos;s not all work. Google offers great benefits, collegial environments, and plenty of smart people to hang with. </p>
<p>Sound appealing?  We really want to meet software engineers who are burning to solve big problems&#x2014;and who wouldn&apos;t mind working where great solutions are happily rewarded. </p>
<p>To apply, send your resume AND copies of your unofficial transcripts to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#94f7fbf8f8f1f3f1fefbf6e7bfc1d6d7d4f3fbfbf3f8f1baf7fbf9"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="492a2625252c2e2c23262b3a621c0b0a092e26262e252c672a2624">[email&#xA0;protected]</span></a>.
