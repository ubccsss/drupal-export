<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>This term the CSSS is offering a brand new service for all CS undergrads: free hosting of Subversion version control repositories for student projects.</p>
<p>Ever try to hack and hack at a function only to realize your original attempt was pretty close, but you can&apos;t get it back because you&apos;ve spent the last three hours rewriting it? Ever work on a group project and get tired of sending e-mail back and forth with your code attached in zip files? Version control solves all of these problems by providing an Internet-accessible repository which stores not only the code you are currently working on, accessible to all group members, but also the entire history of your files so you can grab older versions if needed.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="http://svn.thecube.ca/">http://svn.thecube.ca/</a> and create an account. You get to create up to 5 repositories, each of which can grow up to 50MB. You can share access with as many other people as you wish, for group projects.</p>
