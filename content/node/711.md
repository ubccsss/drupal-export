<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>UBC&apos;s new ACM chapter invites you to our first event: a presentation by <strong>Mik Kersten on Task Focused Programming with Mylar</strong>.</p>
<p>Mylar is a task focused UI for Eclipse that makes working with very large workspaces as easy as working with small ones. It supports task management and monitors your work activity to identify information relevant to the task-at-hand. (source: http://kerstens.org/mik)</p>
<p><strong>Speaker: Mik Kersten</strong>, leader of the open source Mylar project, UBC Ph.D. student<br>
<strong>Date</strong>: Thursday, March 1st, 2007<br>
<strong>Time</strong>: 5:00 - 6:00 pm<br>
<strong>Location</strong>: DMP 110<br>
<strong>Who</strong>: You! This talk is recommended to all students interested not only in Java development, but also in software engineering practices (and problems associated with them) and user interfaces in general.</p>
<p>Join us to find out more about Mylar, Mik, and ACM!</p>
<p><strong>Pizza and Pop will be served.</strong></p>
<p>Further information:<br>
Software developers are inundated with information: the systems on which developers work often comprise hundreds of thousands of lines or more of source code, developers&apos; email inboxes are clogged with notifications of new bugs reported and so on. Many of the tools developers use have been engineered to present and deliver this information as fast as possible. Mik&apos;s research aims to reverse this trend by presenting just the information a developer needs when they need it by exploiting structure and patterns in the ways developers work. This talk presents the results of the Mylar project (<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/mylar">http://www.eclipse.org/mylar</a> ) that is changing the way developers work by focusing the UI of the Eclipse IDE to show only the information relevant to the task-at-hand.</p>
