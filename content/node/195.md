    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><img src="/files/presentor.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">For those of you who didn&apos;t attend this extremely popular event last year, <b>In My Experience</b> is basically the straight-dope on Computer Science.  Hear from several CS students, in all stages of their degree and what they are doing.  If you have that burning question, like, &quot;Should I go into co-op?&quot; (of course!), or &quot;Should I do a double major or honours?&quot; (well, duhhh...), this is the place to get your answers - from peers who&apos;ve had to make those same choices.</p>
<p>What&apos;s the state of CS in general?  Hear why those naysayers who claim we&apos;re doomed to be unemployed upon graduation are very wrong.  All past participants have agreed that this was extremely helpful so don&apos;t miss out!</p>
<p>And... ahem, where there be speakers, there be giveaways ;-)  But even if you don&apos;t get to snag a t-shirt or one of those newfangled cdroms, I guarantee you that you&apos;ll definitely snag something way more valuable - helpful advice that could make a difference in your education or career.  It&apos;s what you make of it, and it&apos;s your experience!</p>
