All teams will be co-ed. This is a great on-campus opportunity to get away from staring blankly at your computer screen and meet other students in the Computer Science faculty. We&#xA0;will compete against other faculties such as Foresty, Math, Engineering, and Arts to name a few.&#xA0;When the other faculties see the CPSC students ready to kick some butt, saying to themselves, &quot;This is&#xA0;madness...,&quot; we will swiftly respond, &quot;....Madness??, THIS! IS! JAVA!!&quot; Please forgive me&#xA0;for my &quot;300&quot; movie rip-off.</p>
