<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>On November 15, for the first time, UBC is hosting the Pacific NW region ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest.<br>
UBC&apos;s teams have won this regional competition for the last five years (beating teams from Stanford, Berkeley, UW, SFU, ...) and gone on to the world finals.</p>
<p>We need your help to host the regional competition.</p>
<p>As a volunteer, you will get free food, a free t-shirt, and a chance to help run a major programming contest with teams from across the province.  Please email Chelsey at: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9aeff4feffe8fde8fbfeb7f3f4fcf5daf9e9b4eff8f9b4f9fb"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c9bca7adacbbaebba8ade4a0a7afa689aabae7bcabaae7aaa8">[email&#xA0;protected]</span></a> to sign up.  We need people to assemble registration packets, register teams, deliver balloons and printouts during the contest, help with meals, and help make sure everything runs smoothly.</p>
<p>Volunteer orientation happens Friday evening, November 14 (with free pizza), and the contest is Saturday, November 15 (with free meals all day).</p>
