<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><strong>Meet the Teachers</strong> is another fun event that usually happens at the start of second term.  Having gone almost through half of the academic year already, you&apos;re no doubt full of lots of suggestions on how to make your next 4 (or less) years at UBC better.  What courses could be added or what things would you like to see?  Do you support issues like mandatory laptop programs that other Computer Science faculties in the States are doing?</p>
<p>Learn what the department has been working on in the last year on issues brought up in past meetings and suggest your own constructive suggestions for the improvement of teaching - for the future.  It&apos;s like that old saying - &quot;a penny for your thoughts&quot;, except these days, it&apos;s likely to be pizza.  ;-)</p>
