Are you interested in knowing more about the various areas of research of our professors? Come talk to various professors and check out research posters that your fellow undergrad students have put together. Learn more about research<br>
opportunities within the department (such as USRAs, directed studies, and honours theses). Vote for the best poster!</p>
<p>For those students interested in doing summer research or applying for USRAs, this will be a great opportunity for you to talk to professors who have ongoing research projects for undergrads!</p>
<p>There will be pizza, donuts, juice and pop! Please enter your name in <a href="https://www.doodle.com/uabcsbapfa9ihgfu">the doodle poll</a> if you are interested in coming so we know how much food to order.</p>
