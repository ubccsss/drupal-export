<p>The CSSS is looking for volunteers to help with the running of our BBQs. These are one of our more popular events and we require more volunteers to keep them running. All volunteers will receive a FREE burger (or hot dog) for their trouble. If anyone is interested, please e-mail our VP Social, Sean <vps [at]="" thecube.ca="">with your interest and let him know of your availability throughout the week.</vps></p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>The Cube</p>
