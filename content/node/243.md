    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><img src="/files/tw_logo.gif" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">We&apos;ve just received word that UBC is one of the invited institutions in <b>Electronic Arts&apos;</b> first ever programming competition, <a href="http://info.ea.com/company/company_tw.php"><b>Tank Wars</b></a>.  This is an AI programming competition, similar to Project Hoshimi, where students are given an API to use, to create intelligent bots that wage war!</p>
<p>EA looks to have outdone itself by including a code base, that compiles on Windows (.NET), Linux, and Mac (Xcode)!  So, unlike other programming competitions, there&apos;s a great amount of freedom in whatever development environment you prefer.  The contest runs through <b>January 15th, 2006</b>, so this sounds like an excellent activity to pass time away during the holiday season, if you&apos;re raring to scratch that programing itch.  And not to mention, it&apos;s exclusive to you guys (and a few other Canadian institutions), so I&apos;d say there&apos;s a decent chance of winning.  But you&apos;ll have to get past me first :P (which shouldn&apos;t be too hard).  Let&apos;s aim for more than 4 entries, eh?</p>
<p>And although it doesn&apos;t specify it explicitly, if you&apos;re looking to get the attention of EA for whatever reason - co-op student or summer intern - this might be a way of getting your foot in the door :-)</p>
