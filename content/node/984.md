<strong>You have received a nudge from CSSS!</strong></p>
<p>Enjoy the last taste of summer.... (weather permitting)</p>
<p>The first annual CSSS Beach Day will take place on Spanish Banks this Saturday, September 22nd from 2pm to &quot;when the party ends&quot;.  Activities include 5 on 5 soccer tournament (~$50 prize to winners), volleyball, baseball, and frisbee. Bring something to share, and we&apos;ll provide the rest (even ice cream)!   </p>
<p>For those of you who don&apos;t know where that is, you can come down to Reboot Cafe at 1:30pm and join up with us. For those that don&apos;t have rides, come by and we&apos;ll find a way to get you down there.
