<!--break--><p>You must get your photos taken at Evangelos if you want to be included in the class composite and the yearbook (for Dec and May graduation). Photos taken at another company (such as Artona) will not be included in this years composite. If you know you won&apos;t order any photos, you can book a shortened appointment just to take a picture for the class composite. There is no charge for that.</p>
<p>Appointments can be booked by phone or online via their website. A regular appointment requires a $35 deposit for the photo previews. If you choose not to order any photos and return the previews undamaged, your money if refunded. If you choose to order photos, that amount is deducted from the package you chose.</p>
<p>Come to the CSSS Office (X139) to pick up an info sheet with tips for getting your grad photos taken. </p>
<p>Please book your appointment as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
