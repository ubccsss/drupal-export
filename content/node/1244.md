If you have any web, mobile, or desktop programming experience then fill out this two-minute survey to see if you qualify for the focus group. Those selected will be notified by e-mail on Wednesday, May 13th. Pizza will be served at each session, and this is a great way to make some easy money for simply showing up and participating in a discussion.</p>
<p>The date of the focus group is May 25.<br>
The time and place are to be announced.</p>
