<i>&quot;The Extreme Blue&#x2122; program is IBM&apos;s premier internship for top-notch students<br>
pursuing software development and MBA degrees. If you&apos;re chosen for the program,<br>
you become part of a team working in one of a dozen Extreme Blue labs around the<br>
world. Your team&apos;s challenge: develop the technology and business plan for a new<br>
product or service that addresses an existing market challenge.&quot;</i></p>
