Are you interested in algorithms, but find the theory<br>
a bit dry?  Do you want a chance to actually implement<br>
the algorithms instead of just learning about them? Try<br>
<b>CPSC 490</b>!  This student directed seminar -- coordinated<br>
by 2 members of the ACM programming team -- will give<br>
you a chance to learn the fundamental algorithms, and<br>
then apply them to actual programming problems (if you<br>
are thinking of interviewing with Microsoft or Google,<br>
this is exactly the kind of thing you want to be able to do).  </p>
<p>The class counts as a regular 400-level CPSC course.  A time has not<br>
yet been chosen for the course: once students have registered, a time<br>
will be selected that fits everyone&apos;s schedule. <b>CPSC 320 is a<br>
pre-requisite</b> for this course.</p>
