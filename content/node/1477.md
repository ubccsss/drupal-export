<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>HiretheWorld is a Vancouver based business that connects employers with computing students for short term projects. The budget and scope of these projects are variable but it&#x2019;s easy to browse through and find the project that suits you.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hiretheworld.com/freelance/jobs/2853/">JQuery Fullscreen Accordion</a> (flexible budget)</li>
<li><a href="https://hiretheworld.com/freelance/jobs/2697/">PHP/mySQL fix</a> ($85)</li>
<li><a href="https://hiretheworld.com/freelance/jobs/2728/">Wordpress Theme Upload Help</a> ($30)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#x2019;re looking for some interesting/challenging projects or looking to boost the bank account, our site might be a good fit. It&#x2019;s completely free to join, apply and to discuss the projects with employers. To help us advertise to bring in more employers for you, we do retain a percentage of the payment you receive (never more than 10%) which is indicated very clearly when you are applying.</p>
