    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">Nominations for CSSS executive positions for the 2016&#x2013;2017 academic year are now open. To run for election, you must be nominated by ten undergraduate members of the Computer Science department, on your <a href="/files/2016_CSSS_Nomination.pdf">nomination form</a>.<br><br>
New for this year is the option for a Joint Ballot. In this option, two candidates will run together, each holding office for one school term (the candidates will hold office jointly during the Summer Session). Details about this will be provided at the Semi-Annual General Meeting on Tuesday, March 15th, and will be voted on as a constitutional change.<br><br>
Please submit the completed nomination form to a current CSSS Executive by noon on Wednesday, March 30th, 2016. If you have any questions, please contact returning officer Brian Chau at &lt;<code>elections[at]ubccsss[dot]org</code>&gt;</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-dates field-type-datetime field-label-above"><div class="field-label">When:&#xA0;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><span class="date-display-range"><span class="date-display-start">Monday, March 14, 2016 - 00:00</span> to <span class="date-display-end">Wednesday, March 30, 2016 - 12:00</span></span></div></div></div>    <footer>
