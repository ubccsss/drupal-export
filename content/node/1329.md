This involves reading and rating summaries of meeting conversations. The task takes 1 to 1.25 hours and the compensation is $10. We will be running the experiment for the remainder of the week, and through the middle of next week. Scheduling is flexible. Please contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#781f191a0a111d1415381b0b560d1a1b561b19">Gabriel Murray</a> if you are interested.
