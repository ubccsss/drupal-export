The FoWCS Committee and the <a href="http://www.jadeproject.ca/">Jade Project</a> are sponsoring a new program for high school girls called <b>ChicTech</b>. Teams of four girls and one teacher from area high schools will create web sites for non-profit organizations, and all of their projects will be judged in a competition at UBC at the end of the year. More information about the project is available at <a href="http://www.chictech.ca">http://www.chictech.ca</a></p>
<p>Who We Need:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mentors</b>: Teams of two UBC students (one male, one female) will mentor one team each in the spring to encourage and help them with their projects. Requires only ONE in-person visit to the team; thereafter you can communicate with them via phone and/or email.
</li><li><b>Speakers</b>: During the month of November, we need volunteers to visit IT or CAPP classes in area high schools (Vancouver, Richmond, North &amp; West Van) and talk a little about ChicTech for ~10 minutes. We will provide a script and arrange for a public speaking training session. You can do as few or as many schools as you like. If you are an alum we can arrange for you to visit your old high school.
</li></ul>
