<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Hi there! </p>
<p><a href="http://www.uadz.org">www.uadz.org</a> is a free classified ads posting service for UBC students to sell and buy anything peer to peer. Our bulletin boards around campus have always been crowded with ads, and it is neither eco-friendly nor convenient for most students because new ones will soon cover up old ads. With Uadz, people could save their time and money from typing and printing out paper ads ; instead, just go on the website, and everything is fast and easy. Since the website is designed for students, people can always have their transactions done on campus. The website is very user-friendly, with instant image upload and Google map integration. </p>
<p>Check it out, take a minute to post your ads online and let your fellow students know about this exciting new website as well! Especially for now since you probably have a lot of Old Books to Sell and Save Money on New Textbooks!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>The Uadz Crew </p>
