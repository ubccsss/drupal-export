<p>Abstract: I&apos;m interested in how people communicate through the sense of touch, and how haptic information transfer interacts with perception in other modalities. As time and interest permit, I&#x2019;ll discuss two very different kinds of haptic communication that my group has been studying recently. The first is <em>abstract</em> information, delivered one-way to your hand encoded in complex vibrations. We&#x2019;ve found that humans are better at this than you might expect&#x2014;depending on how the sensations are created; and the medium has potential for low-effort, background communication. In the second kind, we&#x2019;re examining haptically communicated <em>affect</em>: what&#x2019;s behind feels that we like or don&#x2019;t like&#x2014;can this be predicted or quantified? How do we communicate emotion haptically, to people or animals, and is this an essential part of emotional communication more generally? We&apos;re building a highly sensed animatronic Creature as an experimental platform, which we plan to use for basic study and in a therapeutic setting.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ll meet this time in the HCI Learning Studio, a resource created with a special grant by the CS HCI faculty for studio-style courses. Snacks possibly available for early arrivals.</p>
