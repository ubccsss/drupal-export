The MITACS Industrial Math Summer School is a new initiative aimed at providing<br>
undergraduate students with an opportunity to do mathematical research in groups<br>
on real-world problems.  We will combine students from different academic backgrounds<br>
in teams of four or five to work on problems submitted by local companies, research<br>
labs and non-profit organizations.  Each team will work for one month on one problem.</p>
