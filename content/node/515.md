This is a call for students who want to get involved in<br>
next year&apos;s IMAGINE event as Squad Leaders.   Given that<br>
our department admits students directly to first year,<br>
we have a special CPSC Squad so it&apos;s going to be important<br>
to identify a Squad Leader from our student group. </p>
<p>Check out the <b>attachement</b> to this post if you are interested, as well the deadline<br>
for your application is <b>Octobert 30th</b>! </p>
