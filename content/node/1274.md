    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>As you all know, Bill Aiello&apos;s term as the Department Head will end in June 2010. The Dean of Science has decided on an internal search and is in the process of forming a head search committee, which includes one elected undergraduate student representative. As the Associate Head on Faculty Affairs, I have been asked to oversee this process.</p>
<p>Duties:<br>
Apart from attending meetings of the committee, the representatives may assist in surveying the department on potential candidates, and may help to collect assessments on candidates. The representatives are expected to consult widely and bring views and concerns to the search committee. They may also be responsible for planning and organizing search-related meetings and events internal to the department.</p>
<p>Eligibility:<br>
Any full-time undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science. Nominations in by next Friday, the 13th with the election being held on the 20th.</p>
