<p>Donut sales, LAN parties, BBQ&apos;s, tons of info sessions.  We&apos;d like to hear from you what went &quot;right&quot; for you and what you think we needed improvement on.  Or suggestions on what you would like to see us do.  Seriously, the sky&apos;s the limit here, and we promise to consider anything you bring up.  There&apos;s still another whole term to go, and so much more in store for you guys, so please let us know in the Forums.</p>
<p>I think this was a really successful term for us, and we certainly hope we made a difference in your routine.  Whether it was dropping by for a quick snack of ever-healthy potato chips and pop, or burning hours in front of our popular Xbox, or just socializing at one of our many events, it was all good :-)</p>
<p>So, now&apos;s the time to hit the books (in case you haven&apos;t done so already), and blast through 3 weeks of exams.  Study smarter, not harder and may the force be with you... always.</p>
<p><i>PS:  If you haven&apos;t picked up your clothing orders by now, just drop us an email at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3a0b0b0b083b7aba6a0b6a1a6eda0a2"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b0d3c3c3c3f0c4d8d5d3c5d2d59ed3d1">[email&#xA0;protected]</span></a> and we&apos;ll try to arrange something.  Or, if you&apos;re going to be busy, you can always pick it up in the new year.</i></p>
