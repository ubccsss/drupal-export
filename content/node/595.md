Want to share your Com-Sci skills with others, especially grade 6 girls?</p>
<p>A FoWCS initiative, GIRLsmarts is a computer science workshop for grade 6 girls.<br>
On Jan. 27 and Feb. 3 2007 the workshop will be run the fourth time here at UBC .<br>
GIRLsmarts is free for participants (the girls) and we are now recruiting volunteers.</p>
<p>If you are interested in helping out with advertising, activity facilitators, group leaders, meeters and greeters... or other miscellaneous tasks that have to get done to keep the workshop running smoothly, check out out website at jadeproject.ca/girlsmarts (editor&#x2019;s note: website now closed and obtained by unrelated organization) for more info about the workshop and the volunteer application process.</p>
<p>And if you still have any questions, email us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#791e100b150a14180b0d0a391e14181015571a1614"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="aacdc3d8c6d9c7cbd8ded9eacdc7cbc3c684c9c5c7">[email&#xA0;protected]</span></a>.</p>
