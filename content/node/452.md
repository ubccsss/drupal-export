<p>The date has been set as <strong>March 31</strong>! That&apos;s a Friday for all you without a calendar near by.   This year&apos;s grad dinner will follow the success of previous years with another fun filled boat cruise.  </p>
<p>So... for 20 dollars (there&apos;s a healthy subsidy there), you get to spend a one-of-a-kind evening complete with a first-class sit-down dinner aboad a chartered yacht!  Last year&apos;s event went extremely well, and this year, we expect to do even better!  </p>
<p>Menu:	Chef Carved Prime Rib Roast Beef, Swiss Potatoes, Vegetarian Penne Pasta in Tomato Sauce, Steamed Vegetables, Three Bean Salad, Caesar Salad, Dinner Rolls, Assorted Pastries for Dessert, Coffee &amp; Tea</p>
<p>Boarding time is <strong>6pm</strong>.  The boat will depart at 6:30pm and return later that evening at 10:30 pm.  </p>
<p>We&apos;re giving preference to graduating students (and one guest), but computer science students from all years are invited to attend.  So, if you&apos;re interested in going, see your friendly CSSS execs in X139 for more details and to sign up for this exciting event!  <strong>You must buy your tickets by Wed Mar 26th! Don&apos;t delay!</strong></p>
