<p>What is EA? Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a comprehensive framework used to manage and align  an organization&apos;s information technology (IT) assets, people, operations, and projects with its operational characteristics. EA is a vital component of successful organizations and can have a significant impact on business competitiveness. In brief, planning for the development of information systems is similar to planning for buildings and cities. You will learn more about EA from the professionals at this conference.</p>
