Please donate and leave your mark on UBC by helping future students who are struggling<br>
financially to reach their dreams.</p>

across from Dempster and donate what you can <b>before April 10th.</b></p>
<p>You can also make a one time donation on-line at <a href="http://www.supporting.ubc.ca/classact" target="_blank">www.supporting.ubc.ca/classact</a>. Click on<br>
the &apos;donate now&apos; button and specify Class Act as the campaign that you want to donate to<br>
