<p>If you want to play in the foosball tournament, you can sign up on the bulletin board outside the cube office, OR at the LAN party on friday. There will be a final showdown, one on one between the winning team to see who gets to take home a brand spankin&apos; new copy of NBA Live &apos;06 for Xbox.</p>
