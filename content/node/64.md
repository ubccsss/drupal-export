<p>Here&apos;s the deal. If you and your CS friends want to make up a team for any of the UBC REC intramural leagues or tournaments, the CSSS will subsidize you 3$ for every person on that team.</p>
<p><img src="/files/longboatlogo.gif"></p>
<p>Day of the Long Boat is coming up, on October 1st and 2nd. The last day to register is Wednesday September 21, and it costs 165$ for a student team. You can register teams of 10-12 in person at the SRC (student recreation centre by the B-line bus loop) OR online at www.rec.ubc.ca.</p>
<p>Once you have registered your team, you can contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f09a92829f9f9bb093838383de9383de859293de9391">[email&#xA0;protected]</a> so that you can get your subsidized portion of the fee back (save your receipts!!).</p>
<p>There are also a bunch of different league sports happening this term which CSSS will also contribute to if you get a full squad of CS&apos;ers out for.<br>
For first term the leagues that you can join are:</p>
<p>ultimate frisbee<br>
handley cup soccer<br>
cross volleyball<br>
nitobe basketball<br>
todd ice hockey<br>
bodin ball hockey<br>
dodgeball<br>
flag football</p>
<p>Make sure you check WWW.REC.UBC.CA for registration deadlines because they are coming up within the next week or two!!!! You can also find details here about game times and locations.</p>
<p>REC also offers a wide variety of other activites including dance, fitness, marial arts and outdoor activities to name a few. There are smaller one-time tournaments offered through the year -- gladiator, ice wars, pool pandemonium which are also UBER fun, especially if youre looking for that one night of fantastic excitement...</p>
<p>If you have any questions or need clarifications e-mail Jenny your CS sport rep at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0e646c7c6161654e6d7d7d7d206d7d207b6c6d206d6f">[email&#xA0;protected]</a> OR you can always go to www.rec.ubc.ca OR swing by the SRC and pick up a program guide for everything you ever wanted to know about sports and recreation at UBC.</p>
<p>SO GO!!!! get away from that computer screen and play play play!!!! (we all need that once and awhile) Find a team, have fun and run around!!! :)</p>
