Show us your artistic skills and design an original logo for our CSSS (the Cube) clothing!</p>
<p>The logo should be significantly wider than it is high (to go across the chest of the shirts), and should be at least 600 pixels wide and at least 400 pixels high to ensure good quality printing (though you&apos;re encouraged to submit larger images or vector formats).</p>
<p>The winner will get their choice of either <b>one t-shirt plus one hoodie free</b> or <b>three t-shirts free</b> and the winning logo will be featured on our t-shirts for this year! </p>
<p><b>Colour restrictions</b>: None, however keep in mind that we will be grey scaling your logo for our t-shirts. So make sure it looks good grey scaled as well!<br>
<b>Deadline</b>: November 7, 2008<br>
<b>Winner announced on or before</b>: November 14</p>
<p>To submit your logo, send it to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e586969696a5918d8086908780cb8684"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8deefefefecdf9e5e8eef8efe8a3eeec">[email&#xA0;protected]</span></a>, with &quot;Logo Contest&quot; as the subject.</p>
