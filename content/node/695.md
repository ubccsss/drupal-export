    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>We invite all primadonna coders, and all wannabe hackers to test their mettle in the <strong>UBC/SFU 3rd Annual Winter Programming Contest</strong>! You think you can code your way out of a paper bag?  We doubt it.</p>
<p>We awaits you with 6 programming challenges to prove your worth. Solve them and you&apos;ll be a blip on our radar when we choose the ACM teams next fall; fail and you will not surprise us.</p>
<p>The challenge runs from <strong>12:30-3:30</strong> on <strong>Saturday, February 3</strong>.  You will no doubt need help, so bring a friend and enter as a team.  There will be registration and practice rounds between 10:30-12:00 (You can register by sending Matthew an email before, or come in during this period).  The contest will be followed by <strong>free pizza</strong> and <strong>prizes</strong> from 3:30 to 4:00 pm.</p>
<p>Language: C, C++, Java<br>
OS: Unix (vi, emacs, eclipse, etc), Windows (dev-c++, eclipse, notepad, etc)</p>
<p>We will award prizes to those who embarrass themselves the least.  If you have not previously participated in programming contests, this page ( <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~minsk/acm.html">http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~minsk/acm.html </a>) may be helpful for you.
