    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><img src="/files/shlomo.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">There are many applications where one needs to search for a &quot;function&quot; that has &quot;minimal energy&quot; while satisfying some boundary constraints. As a  simple example, consider the problem of  finding the minial area soap bubble surface that spans a wireframe boundary.  Numerical methods are typically only good at finding local minima to such varational problems. </p>
<p>In this talk, we show how global optima can be found as the limit of a set  of purely combinatorial problems. These combinatorial problems can be  thought of higher dimensional analogues of the  &quot;shortest path in planar  graph&quot; problem. For example, when the problem dimension is 3, the  combinatorial problem is to find a &quot;discrete minimal surface&quot; in a volumetric cellular complex. We then show how these combinatorial problems can be solved in polynomial  time by reducing them to instances of MIN-CUT. </p>
<p>If time permits, we will also explore an application of these ideas to 3-camera stereo vision. </p>
