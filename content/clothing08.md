<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Once again, we are selling CS swag again this year!  Available for purchase are sweatshirts and t-shirts in a variety of different sizes and colours.</p>
<p>This year, the price of the sweatshirts have been <strong>lowered 5 dollars</strong> and we now accept Paypal!  You do not need a Paypal account to use Paypal - you can just use a credit card too.  Of course, if you like, you can still choose to order online and pay in person instead, but you will need to come and track one of us down in order to do so.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding clothing orders should be sent to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#711e0315140331051914120413145f1210"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3f504d5b5a4d7f4b575a5c4a5d5a115c5e">[email&#xA0;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p>You can place your orders on theCube online at http://order.thecube.ca (editor&#x2019;s note: now closed).  Please order by <strong>March 7th, 2008</strong>, so we can get these back to you in time for exams!</p>
