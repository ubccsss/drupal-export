<a name="3"></a><strong>UBC Masters of Management in Operations Research Info Session</strong></p>
<p><em>When: Wednesday Oct. 12, 12:00-1:30pm<br>
Where: Kaiser 2020, Volta Room</em></p>
<p>Do you want to solve real business problems?<br>
Are you interested in a career in consulting or business analysis?<br>
Do you have a background in computer science, engineering, mathematics, economics, or other quantitative fields?<br>
If so, we would like to invite you to a special information session on the UBC Master of Management in Operations Research program.</p>
<p>Presenter:      Mats Gerschman, Managing Director Centre for Operations Excellence, Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia<br>
* Drinks and light snacks will be provided. * </p>
<p>The 16-month UBC Master of Management in Operations Research (MM in OR) program trains students to become professional business analysts by providing rigorous technical fundamentals, practical consulting skills, and real-world problem solving experience.</p>
<p>MM in OR students work closely with internationally renowned faculty, business leaders, and outstanding peers to develop and realize their goals in a professional environment. Every student receives generous financial support by completing an intensive 5-month applied project with an industrial partner. MM in OR graduates have excellent employment potential and embark on rewarding careers where they put their skills to use.</p>
<p>The MM in OR program is an ideal alternative to an MBA for technically-oriented students looking for a professional business degree that utilizes their quantitative skills. For more information, please visit www.coe.ubc.ca/mmor.</p>
<p>If you are interested in attending this session, please RSVP to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3b52555d547b58545e154e595815585a">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>, or call 604-822-1800, by October 7. Admission is FREE.</p>

<a name="6"></a><strong>CS Clothing Contest 2005</strong></p>
<p>The CSSS wants your input again - this time, we&apos;re choosing the logo for our clothing contest!  As you know, we all like to style ourselves CS students, so this is, understandably, of enormous importance.  Your input is very valuable to us :-)</p>
<p>We received your designs, and to make things a little more interesting, we&apos;ve also brought back the logos from the button contest to make a grand total of 13 designs from which to choose from.  Personally, I&apos;m rooting for *CENSORED* (you&apos;re making our readers biased! -hrmmp)  When you&apos;ve finally made up your mind by reading the entire article, <i><a href="/node/119">head on over to the polls and cast your vote</a></i>!</p>

<a name="7"></a><strong>Peer Tutoring</strong></p>
<p>Wanna be a tutor?</p>
<p>Help solidify your own knowledge of the material, improve communication skills, gain volunteer experience, and help out a fellow student! Don&apos;t be afraid if you think you won&apos;t be able to answer a question. The student you are helping does not expect you to know everything! You can always go to the Learning Centre and get additional help from a TA.</p>
<p>Need a tutor?</p>
<p>Get help with a difficult course! If that&apos;s not reason enough (!!!) you&apos;ll get to meet another student who can probably give you advice on other CS related things, eg. courses to take, great profs, etc. Remember though that they are a student like you so don&apos;t expect them to know everything!</p>
<p>If you&apos;d like to participate, here&apos;s how to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.csss.cs.ubc.ca">www.csss.cs.ubc.ca</a></li>
<li>Create an account on the CSSS website or login with an existing account.</li>
<li>Click &apos;my account&apos; on the side bar</li>
<li>Go to the &apos;edit&apos; tab</li>
<li>Click &apos;UBC&apos;</li>
<li>Halfway down the page you can select whether you would like to request the help of a volunteer tutor, or you would like to volunteer as a tutor.</li>
<li>Enter the courses (or programming languages) you want help with, or you want to tutor in.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Email webmaster[at]csss.cs.ubc.ca if you have any trouble.)</p>
<p>We&apos;ll match you up and then let you go from there! We&apos;ll also have fun informal social sessions for participants.</p>

<a name="8"></a><strong>In My Experience</strong></p>
<p>Are you a senior CS student with plenty of experience under your belt? Are you a combined major, plain CS major, CS honours, cognitive systems major, or studying any of a number of such CS related concentrations? Have you a friend or sibling who may have recently graduated from the UBC CS program?</p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, we want to hear from you! The In My Experience speaker series, an annual tradition that was started last year, has senior students and recent graduates speak to younger CS students who have no idea what they&apos;ve gotten themselves into.</p>
<p>Please email Nakisa at internalvp[at]csss.cs.ubc.ca if you&apos;re interested.</p>
