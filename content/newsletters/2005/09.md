<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Hey all you CSers!  We hope you&apos;ve all been settling into your new year of courses.  Whether you&apos;re straight out of high school--looking like deer in headlights--or in your <em>n</em>th year of studies, just hoping that you might finally graduate after five co-op work terms and going on an exchange to Japan, it would benefit you to make the most of things.  That is, it is highly advisable to take advantage of some of the great events that are happening around you before midterm seasons hits and we&apos;re all peeling ourselves off the floor, trying to dig our way out as the walls of the basement computer labs seem to be getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>Congratulations to your new CS Year Representatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrew Newman, 1st Year Rep &lt;1styearrep(at)csss.cs.ubc.ca&gt;</li>
